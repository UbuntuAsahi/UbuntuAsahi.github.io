Thank you for taking the time to contribute! [Bug reports and pull requests](https://github.com/UbuntuAsahi/ubuntu-asahi) are very welcome.

Ubuntu Asahi is in early development and our contribution process is loose. Following [Asahi Linux](https://github.com/AsahiLinux)' style is encouraged.

Discussion primarily takes place on the `#ubuntu-asahi` channel of [OFTC](https://www.oftc.net/). Channel history can be found on [whitequark's IRC log viewer](https://oftc.irclog.whitequark.org/ubuntu-asahi).

This project and everyone participating in it are governed by the [Ubuntu Asahi Code of Conduct](/conduct). Please report unacceptable behavior to [conduct@ubuntuasahi.org](mailto:conduct@ubuntuasahi.org).
