Thank you for taking the time to contribute! [Bug reports and pull requests](https://github.com/UbuntuAsahi/ubuntu-asahi) are very welcome.

Ubuntu Asahi is in early development and our contribution process is loose. Following [Asahi Linux](https://github.com/AsahiLinux)' style is encouraged. Ubuntu Asahi discussion primarily takes place on the `#ubuntu-asahi` channel of [OFTC](https://www.oftc.net/).

This project and everyone participating in it are governed by the [Ubuntu Asahi Code of Conduct](/conduct). Please report unacceptable behavior to [conduct@ubuntuasahi.org](mailto:conduct@ubuntuasahi.org).
