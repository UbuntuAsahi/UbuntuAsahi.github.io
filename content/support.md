Questions are welcome on our IRC channel (`#ubuntu-asahi` on OFTC) and [Fediverse account](https://social.treehouse.systems/@ubuntuasahi).

Issues in Ubuntu Asahi can be reported to [UbuntuAsahi/ubuntu-asahi](https://github.com/UbuntuAsahi/ubuntu-asahi/issues). Issues on this website can be reported to [UbuntuAsahi/ubuntuasahi.github.io](https://github.com/UbuntuAsahi/ubuntuasahi.github.io).

Ubuntu Asahi supports Ubuntu releases for nine months ([the duration of an interim release](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle)). Our Asahi Linux upstream rolls out new dependencies often and we recommend using recent releases.

For hardware support see the [Feature Support](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/Feature-Support) page from Asahi Linux' wiki. Differences between Asahi Linux and Ubuntu Asahi hardware support will be listed on this page.

The best way to support Ubuntu Asahi is to support [Asahi Linux developers](https://asahilinux.org/support/) ðŸ’–
